# 1. Using the = operator (Assignment)
x = 10  # Assigning the value 10 to variable x
y = 20  # Assigning the value 20 to variable y

# 2. Using the == operator (Equality check)
are_equal = (x == y)  # Checking if x and y are equal, which should be False
print(f"Are x and y equal? {are_equal}")  # Output: Are x and y equal? False

# 3. Using the ** operator (Exponentiation)
base = 2
exponent = 3
result = base ** exponent  # Raising 2 to the power of 3
print(f"{base} raised to the power of {exponent} is {result}")  # Output: 2 raised to the power of 3 is 8

# 4. Using the ^ operator (Bitwise XOR)
a = 5  # In binary: 0101
b = 3  # In binary: 0011
xor_result = a ^ b  # Performing bitwise XOR, which should be 6 (0110 in binary)
print(f"The result of {a} ^ {b} is {xor_result}")  # Output: The result of 5 ^ 3 is 6
